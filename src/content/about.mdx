PhD researcher at University of Münster specializing in **probability theory** and applying it to **neural network training dynamics** and **Initialization Schemes**.

### Who am I?

As a researcher, it’s extremely important to me that my work is not just a game of thought. I don’t spend time on problems that (in my view) have no practical relevance. My work focuses on training dynamics of ultra wide neural networks **NTK** and **$\mu P$**. The practical side of this is commonly refered to as **rich regime**, **lazy regime** and **Grokking** which is the transition between the two during training. The latter are often times considered from mostly a practical standpoint with lightweight mathematical theory. To me they are all closely related.

Outside of research, I enjoy what most people would call “hacking”: reverse engineering, taking systems apart, figuring out how they really work. I actually considered studying IT security, but in the end math won, and “hacking” became my hobby.

I also spend an unreasonable amount of time tuning my 3D printer and building random things. 3D printing is fun, but more importantly it makes it possible to prototype ideas fast. I wouldn’t want to give that up. Thus you will find a few posts on this too.
