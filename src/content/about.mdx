## Hello, I'm Frederick Altrock

Welcome to my blog! This is where I share my thoughts, projects, and insights
on a variety of topics that I'm passionate about. 

Feel free to explore the different topics, read through my posts, and don't hesitate
to reach out if you'd like to connect or discuss any of the content.

### What I Write About

Since i am doing a math PHD in probability theory and specifically how neural networks learn, 
a lot of my posts are naturally about math and AI. However, I also enjoy diving into topics 
like reverse engineering, IT-Security,3D printing and sometimes electrical engineering.
