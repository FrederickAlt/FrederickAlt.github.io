I am a PhD candidate at University of Münster, Germany focusing on Probability Theory in Machine Learning, Neural Network Training Dynamics.

My current research and PhD thesis focuses on understanding the training dynamics of ultra wide neural networks using **probability theory**. In particular, I study the emergence of the **Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK)** regime and the $\mu P$ regime as characterized by Greg Yang. I show that even in rich settings like the $\mu P$ regime the layers decouple stochastically for all training time. Furthermore I draw parallels to **lazy** and **rich** training regimes and the phenomenon of **Grokking**.
