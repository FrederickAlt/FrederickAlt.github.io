# Introduction to Rust Programming

Rust is a systems programming language that runs blazingly fast, prevents segfaults, and guarantees thread safety. Let's explore what makes it special.

## Why Rust?

Rust provides the performance of low-level languages like C and C++ while offering memory safety without garbage collection.

### Key Features

- **Memory Safety**: No null pointers or data races
- **Zero-Cost Abstractions**: High-level features with no runtime overhead
- **Ownership System**: Unique approach to memory management
- **Concurrency**: Safe concurrent programming

## Hello, Rust!

Here's your first Rust program:

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
```

## Ownership and Borrowing

Rust's ownership system is its most unique feature:

```rust
fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from("hello");
    let s2 = s1; // s1 is moved to s2

    // println!("{}", s1); // This would error!
    println!("{}", s2); // This works
}
```

## Pattern Matching

Rust has powerful pattern matching:

```rust
match number {
    1 => println!("One"),
    2 => println!("Two"),
    _ => println!("Something else"),
}
```

## Conclusion

Rust is an excellent choice for systems programming, web assembly, and any project where performance and safety are critical.
