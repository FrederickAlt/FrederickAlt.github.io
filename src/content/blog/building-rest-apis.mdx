# Building RESTful APIs: Best Practices

REST (Representational State Transfer) is the most popular architectural style for building web APIs. Let's explore best practices for designing great APIs.

## What is REST?

REST is an architectural style that uses HTTP methods to perform CRUD operations on resources.

## Key Principles

### 1. Use Proper HTTP Methods

- **GET**: Retrieve resources
- **POST**: Create new resources
- **PUT/PATCH**: Update existing resources
- **DELETE**: Remove resources

### 2. Resource Naming

Use nouns, not verbs, for endpoints:

```
✅ GET /users
❌ GET /getUsers

✅ POST /users
❌ POST /createUser
```

### 3. Status Codes

Return appropriate HTTP status codes:

- **200 OK**: Successful GET, PUT, PATCH
- **201 Created**: Successful POST
- **204 No Content**: Successful DELETE
- **400 Bad Request**: Invalid input
- **401 Unauthorized**: Authentication required
- **404 Not Found**: Resource not found

## Example API Structure

```
GET    /api/users          # List all users
GET    /api/users/:id      # Get specific user
POST   /api/users          # Create user
PUT    /api/users/:id      # Update user
DELETE /api/users/:id      # Delete user
```

## Versioning

Include API versioning in your URLs:

```
/api/v1/users
/api/v2/users
```

## Pagination

For large datasets, implement pagination:

```
GET /api/users?page=2&limit=20
```

## Conclusion

Following REST best practices leads to APIs that are intuitive, maintainable, and easy to consume.
