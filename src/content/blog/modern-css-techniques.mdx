# Modern CSS Techniques for 2024

CSS has evolved significantly in recent years. Let's explore some modern techniques that will level up your styling game.

## Container Queries

Container queries allow you to style elements based on their container's size, not just the viewport:

```css
.card {
  container-type: inline-size;
}

@container (min-width: 400px) {
  .card-content {
    display: flex;
  }
}
```

## CSS Grid and Subgrid

Modern layout techniques with CSS Grid:

```css
.gallery {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(250px, 1fr));
  gap: 1rem;
}
```

## Custom Properties (CSS Variables)

Create maintainable themes with CSS variables:

```css
:root {
  --primary-color: #0ea5e9;
  --spacing: 1rem;
}

.button {
  background: var(--primary-color);
  padding: var(--spacing);
}
```

## Cascade Layers

Organize your CSS with cascade layers:

```css
@layer reset, base, components, utilities;

@layer components {
  .button {
    /* component styles */
  }
}
```

## Conclusion

Modern CSS provides powerful tools for creating responsive, maintainable designs. Experiment with these techniques in your projects!
