# Git Workflow Tips for Teams

Git is essential for modern software development. Let's explore best practices for using Git effectively in team environments.

## Branching Strategy

A clear branching strategy prevents conflicts and confusion.

### Git Flow

```
main (production)
  ├── develop (staging)
  │   ├── feature/user-auth
  │   ├── feature/payment
  │   └── bugfix/login-error
```

## Commit Messages

Write clear, descriptive commit messages:

```bash
# Good
git commit -m "Add user authentication with JWT"

# Bad
git commit -m "Fixed stuff"
```

### Conventional Commits

Follow a standard format:

```
feat: add user registration
fix: resolve login timeout issue
docs: update API documentation
refactor: simplify payment processing
test: add unit tests for auth service
```

## Pull Request Best Practices

1. **Keep PRs small**: Easier to review and less likely to have conflicts
2. **Write descriptive titles**: Clear summary of changes
3. **Add context**: Explain why, not just what
4. **Request reviews**: Get feedback from team members
5. **Update regularly**: Rebase or merge main to stay current

## Useful Git Commands

### Stash Changes

```bash
git stash save "WIP: working on feature"
git stash pop
```

### Interactive Rebase

Clean up commits before merging:

```bash
git rebase -i HEAD~3
```

### Cherry Pick

Apply specific commits:

```bash
git cherry-pick <commit-hash>
```

## Handling Merge Conflicts

1. Understand both changes
2. Communicate with team members
3. Test thoroughly after resolving
4. Don't force push to shared branches

## Git Aliases

Speed up common commands:

```bash
git config --global alias.co checkout
git config --global alias.br branch
git config --global alias.ci commit
git config --global alias.st status
```

## Conclusion

Good Git practices improve team collaboration and maintain clean project history. Establish conventions early and stick to them!
