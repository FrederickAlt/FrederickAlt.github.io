# Database Design Principles

Good database design is crucial for building scalable and maintainable applications. Let's explore key principles that will help you design better databases.

## Normalization

Normalization reduces data redundancy and improves data integrity.

### Normal Forms

**First Normal Form (1NF)**
- Each column contains atomic values
- Each row is unique

**Second Normal Form (2NF)**
- Meets 1NF requirements
- No partial dependencies

**Third Normal Form (3NF)**
- Meets 2NF requirements
- No transitive dependencies

## When to Denormalize

Sometimes denormalization improves performance:

- Read-heavy applications
- Reporting databases
- Caching frequently accessed data

## Indexing Strategies

Proper indexing dramatically improves query performance:

```sql
-- Single column index
CREATE INDEX idx_user_email ON users(email);

-- Composite index
CREATE INDEX idx_user_name ON users(last_name, first_name);
```

### Index Best Practices

1. Index foreign keys
2. Index columns used in WHERE clauses
3. Don't over-index (slows writes)
4. Monitor index usage

## Relationships

Design clear relationships between tables:

- **One-to-One**: User to Profile
- **One-to-Many**: User to Posts
- **Many-to-Many**: Students to Courses (via junction table)

## Naming Conventions

Consistent naming makes databases easier to understand:

- Use lowercase with underscores: `user_profiles`
- Singular table names: `user` not `users` (or plural, but be consistent)
- Clear column names: `created_at`, `updated_at`

## Data Types

Choose appropriate data types:

- Use `INT` for IDs
- Use `VARCHAR` for variable-length strings
- Use `TEXT` for large text content
- Use `TIMESTAMP` for dates and times
- Use `DECIMAL` for money

## Conclusion

Good database design takes practice. Focus on clarity, consistency, and scalability from the start.
