# Developer Productivity Tips

Being productive as a developer isn't just about coding faster—it's about working smarter. Here are practical tips to boost your productivity.

## 1. Master Your Tools

Learn keyboard shortcuts for your editor and terminal. This small investment saves hours over time.

### Essential VS Code Shortcuts

- `Ctrl/Cmd + P`: Quick file open
- `Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + P`: Command palette
- `Ctrl/Cmd + D`: Select next occurrence
- `Alt + Click`: Multiple cursors

## 2. The Pomodoro Technique

Work in focused 25-minute intervals with 5-minute breaks. This helps maintain concentration and prevents burnout.

## 3. Automate Repetitive Tasks

Write scripts for tasks you do repeatedly:

```bash
# Git commit and push
alias gcp='git add . && git commit -m "$1" && git push'
```

## 4. Use Code Snippets

Create snippets for common patterns in your language or framework.

## 5. Take Regular Breaks

- Stand up and stretch every hour
- Look away from the screen (20-20-20 rule)
- Take a short walk to clear your mind

## 6. Documentation First

Before diving into code, read the documentation. It often saves debugging time later.

## 7. Version Control Best Practices

- Commit often with meaningful messages
- Use branches for features
- Review your own code before pushing

## 8. Stay Organized

- Keep a to-do list
- Use project management tools
- Document your code and decisions

## Conclusion

Productivity is a skill that improves with practice. Find what works for you and make it a habit!
